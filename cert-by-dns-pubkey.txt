Following idea aims to make it easier to create and update certificate, for people who
do not have easy or comfortable enough access to often update their DNS entries.

( based on https://letsencrypt.github.io/acme-spec/#rfc.section.7.4 )

Usage:

User (once forever) needs to create a keypair of Ed25519 cryptosystem,
it will be called UserKey.

User (once per given domain, forever) will:
- publish in the DNS a TXT record with the b64 encoding of the standard
encoding of his UserKey's public-key part.

User (once per given domain, for each certificate refresh) will:
- create the ceretification request, and will sign it using his Ed25519 privatekey.
- will send the signed request to provider.
- no update to DNS is needed.
